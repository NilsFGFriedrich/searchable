This extension provides an API to easily use Elasticsearch in complex TYPO3 instances.

Features:

* Out-of-the box indexing of pages
* Indexing of extension content via minimal configuration (TCA based indexing)
* Multilanguage support
* Command-line indexing
* Highly configurable
* Highly extendable with your own code

In addition to the already supported features, it is very easy to add your own code if necessary.
No need to write a complete indexer from scratch, instead you can register custom classes for almost every sub-process like preview rendering, link generation and more.

Check the [separate documentation](https://bitbucket.org/pagemachineag/searchable/src/master/doc/index.md) for more information.
