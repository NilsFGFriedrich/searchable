# Extension Manager settings

You can change ES connection settings (such as the hosts) via Extension Manager.

These settings are written to `$_EXTCONF['connection.']`.

## Hosts

The `hosts` key supports a comma-separated list of host URIs.

All available options can be found in the [elasticsearch-PHP configuration docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/php-api/current/_configuration.html#_inline_host_configuration).
